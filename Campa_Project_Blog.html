  <br>While packing my child's lunchbox for school, I don't usually leave treats. But he recently
  discovered my oatmeal cookies sandwiches when I made some for a customer about two weeks ago.
  I had only made a batch of cookies similar to this type once before, and as I am always  
  baking different items, one style never sticks around too long!
  <br><br>I've christened this type of sandwich cookie the "Biscoff Butter Sammy", if you'd like to try one at our bakery.
  As for treats, I don't feel so bad leaving these in his lunchbox once or twice a week because
  there is a whole serving of oatmeal for every 2 sammy's.
  <br>(but don't tell him that!)
